                This was my final project for ECE 4760: Digital Systems Design with Microcontrollers. In this project,
                my group used the using the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller board to create a gesture-controlled
                endless platformer in which the player avoids falling obstacles by moving their avatar left and right
                using the left and right motion of their hand. This project seeks to implement a different form of
                gesture control in an endless running platformer using two pairs of light emitters and receivers: a
                small IR LED will emit light to a mirror suspended above the area in which the player will move their
                hand, and the reflected light will be received by a phototransistor below. When the player’s hand moves
                above the LED to block the light from the phototransistor, Isaac Newton (the player’s avatar) will move
                in the corresponding direction (left/right across the screen) to dodge falling apples.

                This was my final group project for ECE 3140: Embedded Systems. This system operates similarly to a
                telegraph, with a couple of customizations. Through the buttons on the board and its timer, the board
                takes in our signals and translates them to Morse code. Then, it will decode the message to English to
                be output onto the connected laptop’s screen. It can also work in the reverse direction, where an
                English message is input on the host computer and it is encoded and outputted onto the board using the
                on-board LEDs. We limited functionality to messages only consisting of up to 20 uppercase letters and
                spaces. The functionality of our telegraph system could easily be expanded by expanding the dictionary
                to include numbers, punctuation, lowercase letters, etc., at the cost of lowering the maximum character
                limit due to the limited memory of the microcontroller.
